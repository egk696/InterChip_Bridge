# InterChip Bridge

This repository hosts the developed code that implements the proposed InterChip Communication Bridge presented in:

_E.Kyriakakis, K. Ngo and J.Öberg, "Implementation of a Fault-Tolerant, Globally-Asynchronous-Locally-Synchronous, Inter-Chip NoC Communication Bridge on FPGAs", In proceeedings of NORCAS-2017, Linköping, Sweden._

## Structure

* bridge_src: is the main VHDL codebase for the developed interchip bridge component
* other_src: is a VHDL codebase for any other developed components used in the demo projects
